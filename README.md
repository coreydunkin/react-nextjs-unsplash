# NEXT.js Unsplash-js gallery starter

## Introduction
A Next.js application using Unsplash-js api along with SWR to fetch images.

This is a [Next.js][next] application skeleton. 
Pages are in the `pages` directory. 
Components are in the `components` directory.

To get started, clone this repo and run:

```bash
yarn install
```

You can start the dev server by running:


```bash
yarn dev
```

You'll need to fetch an API key from unsplash, then you can link to that api key from your env.local file

Have fun!
