# Upgrowth Candidate Assignment

## Introduction
This forms part of the application process for [Upgrowth](https://upgrowth.com.au/). 
If you just wandered across this repo, and you're interested in working with us, please [get in touch](https://www.upgrowth.com.au/careers)!

This is a [Next.js][next] application skeleton. 
Pages are in the `pages` directory. 
Components are in the `components` directory.

To get started, clone this repo and run:

```bash
yarn install
```

You can start the dev server by running:


```bash
yarn dev
```

## Your Goal

Display a well presented grid of photos from [Unsplash][unsplash]'s API. We'll share an API key with you so you don't have to register your own.

Show us:

- Thoughtfulness
- Pragmatism
- CSS (or SCSS, etc) skills

Have fun!

Feel free to:

- add any library you like
- use any editor

Be ready with this project open and running for the upcoming interview, and we'll explore it and iterate on it together.
